  // To ensure that rules can be lengthened and shortened efficiently, SEQUITUR represents a rule
  // using a doubly-linked list whose start and end are connected to a single guard node, shown for
  // two rules A and B in Figure 3. The guard node also serves as an attachment point for the
  // left-hand side of the rule, because it remains constant even when the rule contents change.
  // Each nonterminal symbol also points to the rule it heads, shown in Figure 3 by the pointer from
  // the nonterminal symbol B in rule A to the head of rule B. With these pointers, no arrays are
  // necessary for accessing rules or symbols, because operations only affect adjacent symbols or
  // rules headed by a non-terminal.
